# Civitype

![font preview](civitype.gif)

The original version of this typeface was drawn by Robert Granjon (active
in the latter half of the 16th century---he also designed a number of
typographic ornaments that have become standard in typography). It is a
typographic rendering of the gothic hand 'batarde'. This version is based
on Louis Ferrand's ATF version of Civilite. There are also versions by
Deberny et Peignot, and Enschede (both with a much more gothic character to
them). Variations on this typeface include Ilse Schuele's 'Rhapsody', and
Schneidler's 'Legend'. Morris Benton designed Typo Upright (also called
Linoscript) which is based on the later development of Civilite.

The type is best used in sizes 18-60pt (the original on which this working
is based is 48pt).
